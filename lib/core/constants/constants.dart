To request a loan, you need to meet the following conditions:

1. Membership in the Group: You must be an active member of the group to be eligible for loan requests. This ensures that only trusted and committed members have access to financial resources.
   
2. Loan Availability: Make sure the loan you are requesting is currently available. Loan availability depends on the group's financial status and the rules governing loan requests.

3. Outstanding Loans: Before applying for a new loan, any outstanding loans must be fully repaid. This policy helps maintain fairness and ensures that loans are circulated responsibly within the group.
   
By following these guidelines, you can seamlessly request a loan and continue benefiting from the group's financial system.

When it comes to loan repayment, there are a few important factors to keep in mind:

1. Group Membership: You must still be a member of the group when repaying your loan. Group membership helps maintain trust and ensures accountability for repayments.

2. Exact Repayment Amount: The amount you repay should match the original loan amount plus any applicable interest. This ensures that loans are settled accurately without discrepancies.

3. Interest Payment: Along with the principal loan amount, a 5% interest fee must be included in your repayment. This small fee helps support the group’s financial sustainability and ensures loans can be offered to more members in the future.

Following these steps will help you repay your loan in a straightforward manner, keeping you in good standing with the group.

Understanding and keeping track of your loan history is crucial for maintaining financial clarity and accountability within the group. Here’s how you can view and manage your loan history:

1. Detailed Loan Records**: Every loan you request, repay, and complete will be meticulously recorded. This allows you to monitor your financial activity and ensures transparency in the group’s loan system.

2. Outstanding Loan Balances: If you have any unpaid loans, you’ll be able to see the outstanding balance in real-time. This allows you to plan your finances effectively and prioritize repayment to remain eligible for future loans.

3. Repayment History: You can view the details of your repayments, including the dates, amounts, and interest paid. This is useful for budgeting and financial planning, as it provides a comprehensive record of all your loan-related financial activities.

By keeping a thorough and transparent record of all loan activities, the group ensures fairness and helps you make more informed financial decisions.
